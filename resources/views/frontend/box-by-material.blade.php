The natural woody texture of Brown Card Stock offers an earthy feel, making it an admirable packaging option for brands that endorse a sustainable approach.

            <h3>Corrugated Stock </h3>
            <p> Corrugated Stock is the most trusted material for heavy-duty packaging. It consists of three sheets of paper. The outer sheets (liners) are plain while the inner one has a wavy structure called fluting. This structure ensures maximum strength and durability for the packaging. You can customize it in desired shapes and styles to create custom boxes for your specific requirements. Corrugated board holds its shape well even under extreme pressures, thus providing maximum protection to the delicate products inside. It is perfect for products that need to be shipped over long distances. Moreover, the inner flute of the Corrugated Stock allows air circulation, which ensures extra protection to the products against changes in temperature and moisture damage. It is a great packaging solution for products that need to be stored for a long time. Above all, corrugated cardboard is eco-friendly, recyclable, and economical too. </p>

            <h3>White Card Stock</h3>
            <p>White Card Stock is a popular material option that is widely used in the packaging industry. It is a durable, eco-friendly, and recyclable packaging option. It offers a great canvas for printing your custom artwork on the retail product packaging. The white base offers a sophisticated look that you may further enhance with gold hot foil stamping, embossed, or debossed artwork for a luxurious impression. When compared to the brown kraft stock, white card stock ensures more vibrant full-color printing as colors pop more against the white base. White Card Stock is long-lasting, sustainable, and cost-effective at the same time. It requires lesser energy in manufacturing and can be recycled multiple times. It is available in different thicknesses to achieve different strengths for the packaging as per the product weight. You can customize it in desired ways to create unique packaging for your brand. </p>

            <h3>Textured/ Linen Card Stock </h3>
            <p> Another great way to add interest to your business cards and other materials is by using whatâ€™s called spot UV coating. This technique applies a glossy coating to specific areas of the printed piece. Spot UV coating adds an interesting contrast to your design by juxtaposing matte and sheen textures.
              <br><br>
              How should spot UV coatings be used? As with foil, spot UV is quite versatile. Its effects range from very subtle to bold and attention-grabbing. The coating could be applied to images and graphics on your piece to make them jump out, or it could be used to accent design elements in the background. You can even use spot UV coatings to create a design on a section .
              <br><br>
              The thickness of spot UV coatings can vary, as with foil printing. A raised 3D element helps them stand out more while also creating additional intrigue. No one can resist running their fingers across a business card with shiny, textured accents!

            <h3>Rigid/ Press Board </h3>
            <p> Rigid Stock is stiff in nature and is mostly used for luxury packaging. It consists of sturdy chipboard of usually 2-3mm thickness that holds its shape in all conditions and thus provides extreme support to the packaged items. It has a strongly built structure that offers a luxurious look and feel. Rigid boxes are considered a premium packaging option for their robust structure and extravagant impression. They can be custom-designed in unique shapes and styles. Rigid Stock material is mostly used for jewelry, perfumes, and gift packaging. Rigid packaging offers a premium feel that ensures an admirable unboxing experience for customers. This alluring packaging option offers many branding capabilities with fancy printing and finishing options such as hot foil stamping, embossing, and debossing along with premium coatings and finishes. </p>
