            <h3>Metallic Foiling </h3>
            <p>Metal Foil Stamping is a great way to add a touch of luxury to your custom packaging boxes. Its fancy impression gives a high-end appeal to the packaging, while the outstanding shine helps them stand out on the crowded shelves. Metallic Foiling can be done on all sorts of paper and cardboard for your desired custom artwork. We do it by using a hot stamping press and a custom metal die of your desired design. The foil sheet goes between the metal die and the paper/cardboard which then gets foil-stamped in the desired areas.
              <br>Unlike the past when we had only gold and silver foiling options, today’s technological advancement has introduced rose gold, copper, holographic, and many other color options for foil stamping. You can even go for multiple colors at once. The great thing is that our metallic foiling does not impact the packaging’s ability to be recycled, which is great to ensure a sustainable environment. Because we believe in being fancy while remaining eco-friendly!

            <h3>Holographic Foiling </h3>
            <p> While the classic gold and silver foiling never goes out of style, our Holographic Foiling takes this lamination to new height of sophistication with its beautiful diffraction of light showing the eye-catching colors of the spectrum at different angles. It is done in the same way as Metal Foil Stamping but includes embossed patterns of your choice. You can get it done on all sorts of paper and cardboard materials for your custom-designed patterns.
              <br><br>This fancy finishing option is an absolute favorite choice in the fashion and beauty industry for its glamorous product packaging. Its iridescent effect adds exclusivity to the packaging, gives a luxurious appeal, instantly attracts attention, increases the worth of the packaged products, and thus results in increased sales and brand value.

            <h3> Aqueous Coating </h3>
            <p>Aqueous Coating is one of the most popular printing options for product packaging. It is a transparent water-based coating that dries quickly and is perfect to achieve high-quality long-lasting prints. Its primary function is to protect the packaging from scratches, fingerprints, abrasion, and other marks that deter its vibrancy and neatness. It is mostly used for food packaging and household products for its increased resistance against water damage.
              <br><br>It gives a fine polished look to the packaging that not only looks good but also feels good to touch. Within it there are different types of finishes including gloss, matte, satin, and velvet-like surface appearance. Aqueous Coating enjoys being a favorite for its cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness.

            <h3> Embossing/Debossing </h3>
            <p> Embossing and Debossing are unique finishing techniques to achieve tridimensional raised or indented impressions of your artwork on the packaging. In Embossing, the design is slightly raised from the surface whereas Debossing does the opposite to give a sunken impression to your desired designs. The process involves male and female dies being pressed against the material stock using both heat and pressure.
              <br><br>Both of the finishes can be felt physically and give a fine experience to touch. They are ideal to highlight the graphics, brand messages, and logos on the packaging with an extra dimension that looks premium and stylish. They strongly give a call to action and thus help brands make instant impression on potential customers and achieve the desired goals.

            <h3>Gloss Lamination</h3>
            <p>Gloss Lamination offers a shiny glass-like finish to the packaging as light bounces off from its surface. Its shine enhances the vibrancy of the packaging with better image contrast, long-lasting prints, and increased sharpness of colors. Gloss laminated boxes outshine the rest of the products placed beside them and thus attract maximum customer attention.
              <br><br>The extra layer of lamination done in this method increases the stiffness and strength of the packaging. The glossy surface also increases the resistance of packaging against scratches, fingerprints, dirt, and dust. Grime and dust particles can be easily wiped off of their glossy surface which contributes to an all-time neatly polished packaging. Gloss laminated packaging looks professional and eye-catching. Moreover, this reasonably priced lamination can help save more money by increasing the shelf life of the custom packaging.

            <h3> Matte Finish </h3>
            <p> Matte Lamination offers a soft blurred look to the packaging that does not reflect light. Its natural look makes it easy to read the printed content. The colors do not stand out on it as sharp as they would on the Gloss Lamination. It flattens the colors and gives the custom boxes a more muted look for a soft toned-down impression. Scratches, smudges, and imperfections are less visible on the matte surface.

            <h3>Spot UV Spot Gloss</h3>
            <p> Spot UV and Spot Gloss are the finishing techniques being used to highlight the key elements of your packaging such as logos, artwork designs, images, taglines etc. It involves using UV light to cure the varnish applied to the specific areas of the printed material. As soon as the targeted area is exposed to UV light, the varnish dries instantly. It gives a shine to the targeted area, seals the color in, and adds an extra layer of protection against moisture as well as any wear and tear. </p>
