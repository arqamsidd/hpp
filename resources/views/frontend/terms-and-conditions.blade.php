      </p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Return and Refund Policy</h4>
      <p>In case you find any defects in the product or the delivered boxes are not as per your ordered specifications then you need to inform us within 3 working days after receiving the order. Though we do not issue a credit or refund to you, you can get a reprinting of the whole order. However, the reprinting of your original order is subject to the determination of the defect or faults with the delivery. If you find ordered products defective, you are required to submit digital proof of defection.<br>
        Our team of experts will be determining whether the defect came from us or is due to any misinformation by the clients. If it is proved on the company side, we will be reprinting your original order. But, if it is on the client's side, all the expenses of reprinting will be paid by the client. You are also bound to return the whole order within seven working days of order delivery to avail of this entitlement.</p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Terms and Conditions for Order Placement, Payment, and Cancellations</h4>
      <p>All prices for our products on this website are in US dollars (USD). Therefore, all the payments for orders will be made in the same currency. Owing to the custom nature of our printing and packaging products and other services we offer, we do not start working on your orders for printing and packaging jobs until you make a full payment that includes all charges, shipping and handling fees, and taxes through our approved payment modes.
        As a part of the order placement process, we need users and buyers to approve the electronic proof of their custom boxes. As soon as you approve the proof, we send the printing jobs to the press department. Once you approve the proof and the job is sent to the press, you are not allowed to make changes to the artwork files and job specifications. You have a very limited time of 4 hours to cancel your order after the proof is approved. Such annulment will cost a fee of 5% of the total order sum earlier the order is negated. We do not guarantee the cancellation of your orders beyond the 24-hour limit.
      </p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Design Orders</h4>
      <p>Half Price Packaging does not issue any refunds or credits for any design service. All orders for designing are non-refundable.</p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Sales Tax Policy</h4>
      <p>We charge our clients with sales tax on all kinds of orders. However, if you are entitled to tax exemption, please make sure to provide your tax exemption certificate when you place the order.</p><br>


      <h4 class="terms-heading">Terms of Artwork/Files Submission</h4>
      <p>Our creative design team makes electronic and hard copy proofs from the artwork provided by the customers. We ask you to submit artwork with a resolution of at least 300 dpi in the final format and CMYK format. In case you fail to provide artwork in CMYK format and at least 300 dpi resolution, we will not be answerable for blurred, contorted, or pixilated printing and color changes when it comes to converting your files into the CMYK format.<br><br>
        You are liable for providing accurate print-ready artwork including any modifications in the alignment or orientation of the pages of your submitted files. Although we take all precautionary measures to avoid the loss of your submitted artwork, we are not responsible for any loss or damage to your artwork files in the process.<br><br>
        By uploading your artwork to our website, you are agreeing that you have the ownership of all the materials or you have the written consent to use the data from the respective entities.<br>
        We reserve the right to refuse any order that we perceive as illegal or have infringed the copyrights of any third party. You are the one to accept responsibility for the content or material you provide for the procession of your orders. We also have the right to deny an order without mentioning any reasons. It is noteworthy that we will not accept any offensive, improper, or indecent material for printing.
      </p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Proofs and Color Accuracy</h4>
      <p>Half Price Packaging requires users and buyers to approve the proof of their printing products or services they order for. We do not send any custom box to the press without the client’s approval. Therefore, customers are responsible for checking the provided proofs by logging in to their accounts. We are not responsible for delays that may occur due to late or non-approval of digital or hard copy proofs. Please keep in mind that the turnaround time that we offer on our website starts when you approve the proof.<br><br>
        It is your obligation to make sure that you have reviewed the proof thoroughly before approving it. You must be checking it against the original file you have submitted to validate and check for possible issues in copy, spacing, font style, final text, bleeds, punctuation, image placement, or layout. The digital proofs do not show transparency, color changes from RGB or Pantone to CMYK or print issues. Also, the application of UV lamination may affect the appearance of the printed colors. Therefore, we are not liable for any such change in prints or colors for the laminated items. Customers are fully liable for all things contained in their final approved proofs.<br><br>
        We will reproduce the colors of the submitted graphic files as accurately as possible, but we cannot guarantee that they match in color and density. Due to inherent limitations in the printing methods and image ink requirements, the accuracy of color reproduction cannot be ensured. We make our best efforts to match the color density. However, we take no responsibility for color differences in the final product and the graphic files sent. Under no circumstances will we entertain any reprints for color variations that may occur during the printing process.<br>
      </p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Gang Printing</h4>
      <p>We at Half Price Packaging do not use gang printing for most of our printing products. At times, based on the client’s requirements we may choose the printing method that we see best suited for printing the particular printing product. </p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Overruns and Underruns</h4>
      <p>Normally, we try to deliver the exact amount of the asked products with an additional amount without charging any additional costs. In case, you receive fewer items than the ordered amount, we will bill for the amount you received only. However, we strictly follow the general trade practice of delivering 5% extra of the ordered quantity.</p><br>

      <h4 class="terms-heading">Changes to our Website and Terms and Conditions</h4>
