   <p>We acknowledge that you may want to return a product to us or cancel your orders due to some reason. We have formed a policy to assist you with any issue that you come across whether it is returning merchandise or canceling orders. This policy applies to all orders submitted to Half Price Packaging. This policy does not disturb any legal privileges you might have under Consumer Protection Acts.<br><br>
   </p>
   
   <h3>Refunds & Returns</h3>
   
   <p>
       As the products and services offered by Half Price Packaging are tailored according to the customer's instructions and guidelines, it is suggested that the client must report to the company if they find supplied products are not according to their specifications or faulty. You can send feedback at <b><a href="mailto:orders@halfpricepackaging.com">orders@halfpricepackaging.com</a></b>  within 3 working days after you receive the order.
   </p>
   
   <h4>Company Side Defects</h4>
   
    <p>
        If the product fault is proven, the company will be liable to reprint the complete order. The company's decision on determining the defect and its responsibility will be final. The customer will ship back the entire order to the company within 7 working days and bear the shipping cost on his own. Customers will provide documents and evidence of defects by providing digital photographs to get orders reprinted.
   </p>
   <h4>Client-Side Defects</h4>
   <p>
       If the ordered product proved defective on the customerâ€™s part and still wants to get cash refunded, they will be bound to send us the whole order. The shipping, product setup, printing, and billing costs will be deducted while refunding.<br><br> 
   </p>
   
   
   <h3>Order Cancellation</h3>
   
   <p>
       We forward the printing jobs to the press department as soon as you accept the proof. After the approval of the proof, you have only 4 hours to cancel your order. A cancellation fee which is 5% of the total order cost will be charged if the order is canceled after processing. Order cancellation is to be informed within 12 to 24 hours
 <br>
If you want to cancel your order after it has been processed in the press, there will be No Refund. On the other hand, we can provide you with a warehouse facility free of cost. We can ship the order at the time of need.
<br> 
For any query about our refund and order cancellation policy, you can reach us via our online chat support, where our sales and customer care representatives can help you in the best way. You can also call us at <b><a href="tel:866-225-2112">866-225-2112</a></b> or mail us at <b><a href="mailto:orders@halfpricepackaging.com">orders@halfpricepackaging.com</a></b>  in this respect.
